    <p>Sup, fellow anonymous! I'm Barrel, your friendly neighborhood nigh schooler and wannabe air force pilot. Obsessed with machines (the gym kind as well as tech kind, you gymbro).</p>
    <p>Currently turning my barrel brain into a overloaded, galaxy typa barrel brain (no offence to other barrels):</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Brogramming (Python, HTML, CSS, JS, Assembly and more I learnt but never used)</li>
        <li>Sysadmin stuff (maintaing home lab for now, but I take on jobs during summer break)</li>
        <li>Hardware hacking (Breaking stuff if its already not broken)</li>
        <li>RF, HAM and ADS-B (I love RF and aircrafts, aviation in general so I track and listen to ACARS messages)</li>
        <li>Professional Photography (Wildlife, portraits, scenery (I travel a lot so comes handy really))</li>
        <li>Bitcoin and Stock Trading (Yes, I print internet money!!)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><em>Last updated: 2025-05-23 (idk man, lost track of stuff)</em></p>

    <p>Help me decide between doing a BE Aerospace or BTech Computer Science - Cybersecurity AHHHHHH</p>
    
    <p>When not brogramming: reading self help books, messing around ADS-B antennas trying to get more range, doing random HAM stuff, messing with hardware and software, listening to ACARS messages on my SDR, learning about aviation, trading stocks or bitcoin or listening to music (gosh its tiring really)</p>
    
    <p>Feynman Said: A PhD is, I think, a good way of learning how to solve problems in a particular subject, but it doesn’t mean you’re very smart. It just means that you were smart enough to get through the system. Any stupid person can get a PhD.</p>
